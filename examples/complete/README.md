# Complete AWS Step Function example

Configuration in this directory creates AWS Step Function and IAM role with large variety of supported AWS Service integrations and custom policies.

Note: You probably don't need to set custom/additional policies but use `service_integrations` only.


## Usage

To run this example you need to execute:

```bash
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```

Note that this example may create resources which cost money. Run `terraform destroy` when you don't need these resources.
